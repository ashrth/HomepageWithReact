        <h3> Customers Want Lower Prices</h3>
        <p>
          To get low prices 85% of the consumers check at least 2 data points
          (Source: BCG Consumer Trends). In various sectors information centred
          buying has been made more efficient by companies like MMT for Travel,
          Policy bazaar for Insurance, Myntra or Shopperstop for Lifestyle
          products. However for rental products, there is no one & to fill this
          need and make the process efficient we launched LetzRent, hoping to
          have a first-mover advantage and dominate the market in the coming
          future.

        <h3> Single KYC</h3>
        <p>
        Renting is a KYC dependent process, every time a customer books a service from a different service provider he/she will have to get a new KYC done. With Letzrent, the hassle of multiple KYC gets removed and with a single KYC, customers can rent from multiple brands.

        <h3> Vast Selection </h3>
        <p>
            Being an aggregator LetzRent offers more otpions than category leaders.

        <h3> Why RentIn The First Place? </h3>
        <p>
           <ul>
            <li> Demographic Twist: Commitment phobic millennials prefer an asset lite life with a bias toward renting rather than buying.</li>
            <li>Flexibility: Renting allows people to upgrade or change assets easily.</li>
            <li>Convenience: With the rental customers dispense with the headache of down payment, maintenance, insurance etc.</li>
           </ul>
